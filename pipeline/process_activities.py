"""Processing stage: derive and persist training-load metrics.

Reads normalized activities, computes per-activity :class:`ActivityMetrics`, and
rolls them up into :class:`WeeklyTraining`. The stage is idempotent: rerunning it
recomputes every value in place using the same analytics used by the dashboard,
so it is safe to call after every sync.
